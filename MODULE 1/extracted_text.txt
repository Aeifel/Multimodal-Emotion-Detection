robertdowneyjr e RIP Bob D. Sr. 1936-2021 ...Last night, dad
passed peacefully in his sleep after years of enduring the ravages
of Parkinson's ..he was a true maverick filmmaker, and remained
remarkably optimistic throughout..According to my stepmoms
calculations, they were happily married for just over 2000 years.
Rosemary Rogers-Downey, you are a saint, and our thoughts and
prayers are with you.
